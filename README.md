## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

The **Fish School Search (FSS)** algorithm was implemented and optimized following the project requirements, using a combination of **C**, **x86 Assembly (SSE/AVX)**, and **OpenMP**. Below is an explanation of the main components and steps of the implementation:

### üìú Key Phases of the Algorithm:
1. **üêü Individual Movement**:  
   - Each fish moves randomly within the search space, adjusting its position according to a local step (`step_ind`).  
   - If the new position improves the objective function (`f`), it is kept; otherwise, the fish reverts to its previous position.  

2. **üåä Instinctive Movement**:  
   - Fish with higher improvements in the objective function influence others.  
   - Fish are attracted towards these better-performing areas, as described by the instinctive movement formula.  

3. **üåÄ Volitive Movement**:  
   - The school contracts towards the barycenter if the total weight of the fish increases (exploitation).  
   - Conversely, if the weight decreases, the school expands to explore new regions (exploration).  
   - This phase is controlled by the volitive step (`step_vol`) and dynamically balances exploration and exploitation.

### üîß Optimization Techniques:
1. **SIMD-Based Optimization**:  
   - **Loop Vectorization**: Exploited SSE and AVX registers to perform operations on multiple data points simultaneously, reducing the number of instructions required per loop iteration.  

2. **ILP-Based Optimization**:  
   - **Loop Unrolling**: Reduced overhead by minimizing conditional checks and jump instructions within loops, allowing the processor to execute independent operations in parallel.  

3. **Cache-Based Optimization** *(Excluded)*:  
   - While **Loop Blocking** was considered to improve cache usage by processing smaller chunks of data, it was not implemented as tests showed no significant improvements for the FSS algorithm.  

4. **MIMD-Based Optimization**:  
   - OpenMP was used to distribute loop iterations across multiple threads, achieving substantial speedup on multi-core processors.  

### üöÄ Implementation Workflow:
1. **Baseline Implementation in C**:  
   - Ensured correctness and modularity.  
   - Established the foundation for performance comparisons.  

2. **Assembly Optimizations**:  
   - Implemented in stages:  
     - Basic conversion from C to Assembly.  
     - Added **SIMD optimizations** with SSE/AVX.  
     - Introduced **Loop Unrolling** for further improvements.  

3. **Parallelization**:  
   - Applied OpenMP directives to critical loops in both 32-bit and 64-bit implementations.  

This structured approach allowed for iterative enhancements, demonstrating the impact of hardware-level optimizations and parallelism on the Fish School Search algorithm.

## üèÜ Results

The performance of the Fish School Search (FSS) algorithm was evaluated across different implementations to assess the impact of hardware and software optimizations. Below is a summary of the results and insights:  

### Results Summary:
1. **C to Assembly Translation**:  
   - The most significant reduction in execution time was achieved by translating high-level C code into low-level assembly, exploiting hardware-specific instructions.  

2. **SIMD Optimization**:  
   - Implementing **SIMD-based optimizations** (e.g., Loop Vectorization using SSE/AVX) resulted in a **75% reduction** in execution time.  

3. **ILP Optimization**:  
   - Applying **Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP)** techniques, such as Loop Unrolling, further reduced execution time by approximately **20%**.  

4. **MIMD Optimization**:  
   - Using **MIMD-based parallelism** with OpenMP added another **20-25% reduction**, demonstrating the benefits of multi-threading on multi-core processors.  

### Performance Chart:
Below is a representation of execution time for two architectures evaluated:  
  - **32-bit with SSE**: Represented by the blue line in the graph.  
  - **64-bit with AVX**: Represented by the orange line.  

Both architectures showed a clear trend of **decreasing execution time** with each additional optimization step. The x-axis shows the levels of optimizations applied, while the y-axis represents the corresponding execution times. This evaluation demonstrates that optimizations such as **SIMD**, **ILP**, and **MIMD** significantly enhance the efficiency of the Fish School Search algorithm, making it well-suited for high-performance computation.

### Observations:
**‚è±Ô∏è Execution Time Sensitivity**: Since execution times were generally less than 1 second, results were highly dependent on the system's current state. For more precise measurements, larger datasets or a greater number of iterations would be required.
